                <h2>Quem somos.</h2>

                <p>We've been designing and developing software for open source content management systems (CMS) for over 6 years. Our company, <a href="http://www.yootheme.com">YOOtheme</a>, is a very popular theme club for Joomla and WordPress. We have great experience in building themes, extensions and plugins and we know WordPress and Joomla by heart. Over the last years we've noticed that our beloved CMS's can't keep up with modern web application trends.</p>

                <h2>What's lacking.</h2>

                <p>Popular CMS's like WordPress, Joomla and Drupal have grown over the time and it is hard for them to adapt to latest web technologies. They are feature heavy, bloated and have to stick to legacy code to keep compatibility with their large extension ecosystem. It will take a lot of work for them to implement modern design patterns and coding standards like today's popular PHP 5.3+ frameworks do.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>A fresh start.</h2>

                <p>Pagekit is a new CMS we are developing right now. It is built from the ground up with a modern architecture in mind. We took the good parts of existing CMS's and mixed them with new ideas. Pagekit will also serve as a web application framework and will provide an awesome platform for theme and extension developers. It's a powerful, modular and lightweight CMS focused on simplicity.</p>

                <p>Everything in Pagekit is modular and extendible by default. This makes Pagekit the perfect platform to build your own web application. In fact, we want Pagekit to be the best platform for a thriving extension and theme ecosystem. That's why Pagekit will feature a built-in marketplace from the beginning. We aim to attract a large number of developers by providing the services they need. Developers can distribute their extensions and themes instantly to a global community of users. The marketplace supports both open-source and commercial extensions. Update notifications, one-click updates and a well thought-out package manager are already in place.</p>

                <h1>Technology <br class="uk-visible-large">that will excite you</h1>

                <p>Pagekit with its web application framework is the right choice for beginners and also for experienced developers. It provides a set of components that solve common tasks in content management with a unified API. The dependency injection container offers great flexibility, as service classes get injected at run-time and can easily be changed. Pagekit uses <a href="http://symfony.com/components">Symfony's HTTP and routing components</a>, which provide a solid and well tested solution for request and response handling. The database layer is based on <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org">Doctrine</a> and is combined with Pagekit's very own object relational mapper that offers a fast and lightweight implementation for object persistence. Pagekit follows the <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md">PSR-1</a> coding standard and leverages powerful features like class autoloading, namespaces, annotations and closures.</p>

                <h1>Simple User Interface</h1>

                <p>Pagekit is focused on simplicity. The user interface will reflect that by being clean, intuitive and efficient. We won't bloat it with unnecessary features. It will have a beautiful, clutter-free look. The Pagekit administration will be built with <a href="http://www.getuikit.com">UIkit</a> - a lightweight and modular front-end framework. This makes the administration fully responsive by default. The whole functionality will work seamlessly on any mobile or touch device.</p>

                <p>Your site's CSS and JavaScript is completely up to you. You choose your favorite front-end framework or just craft everything by hand. No dependencies! You can update Pagekit and your site stays intact.</p>
